**Minimod: A Secure Discord Bot for Server Moderation**

Minimod is a lightweight, security-focused Discord bot designed to help server administrators maintain a safe and well-regulated community environment. Developed with the intention of streamlining moderation tasks while providing robust security features, Minimod stands out as a reliable assistant for both small and large Discord servers.

### Key Features

1.  **User Management & Moderation Tools**
    Minimod provides all the essential moderation commands needed to manage a server effectively:

    *   **Kick/Ban Commands:** Instantly remove disruptive members from the server. Minimod allows admins to specify reasons for kicks or bans, which are logged for transparency and tracking.

    *   **Mute/Unmute:** Temporarily mute users who are spamming or violating chat rules. The bot supports timed mutes, so you don't have to remember to unmute users manually.

    *   **Warning System:** Issue warnings to members who violate server rules. Warnings are stored in a database, allowing admins to track repeat offenders and enforce stricter punishments if necessary.

    *   **Role Management:** Assign and remove roles with ease. Minimod can automate the process of assigning roles to new members based on server rules or specific criteria like joining through an invite link.

2.  **Security Features**
    Minimod places special emphasis on keeping your server safe from threats:

    *   **Anti-Spam Protection:** Detects and automatically mutes or kicks users who engage in spam behavior, including mass messaging, link flooding, or image spam.

    *   **Link/Attachment Filtering:** Blocks unsafe or harmful links and attachments, protecting members from phishing attempts and malware. The bot can be configured to allow or deny specific domains or file types.

    *   **Anti-Raid Mechanism:** Minimod's anti-raid system automatically detects raid attempts and triggers countermeasures. These include locking down channels, automatically banning accounts associated with bot raids, and notifying admins for further action.

    *   **Captcha Verification:** To prevent bot accounts from infiltrating your server, Minimod includes an optional CAPTCHA verification process for new users.

3.  **Automated Logging**
    Minimod maintains detailed logs of all moderation actions taken within the server:

    *   **Action Logs:** Every time a user is kicked, banned, or muted, the bot logs the action, including the responsible moderator and the reason provided.

    *   **User Logs:** All messages deleted, edited, or flagged for inappropriate content are recorded for review.

    *   **Join/Leave Logs:** Track when users join or leave your server, helping you identify patterns or potential security threats.

4.  **Customizable Auto-Mod**
    Minimod features an automatic moderation system that can be configured to your server’s specific needs. Server admins can adjust thresholds for various offenses, allowing the bot to:

    *   Automatically warn or mute users who exceed specified limits for spamming, offensive language, or flooding.

    *   Remove inappropriate content based on custom word filters, with support for blacklist and whitelist configurations.

    *   Temporarily lock channels during high-traffic periods to prevent overloads.

5.  **User-Friendly Interface**
    Minimod’s command interface is designed to be intuitive, making it accessible for both experienced server admins and newcomers to Discord moderation:

    *   **Command Prefix:** The bot operates using a customizable command prefix to avoid conflicts with other bots.

    *   **Interactive Menus:** Some actions, like role assignments and kicks, come with interactive menus and reaction-based inputs, simplifying complex moderation actions.

    *   **Dashboards:** For servers with large amounts of activity, Minimod offers a web-based or in-app dashboard to visualize logs, manage settings, and adjust automated moderation rules with ease.

6.  **Advanced Permissions System**
    Minimod integrates seamlessly with Discord’s permissions system, giving server owners precise control over which users or roles can access certain commands:

    *   **Moderator Role Assignment:** Easily assign moderation rights to specific roles, ensuring that only trusted members can kick, ban, or mute others.

    *   **Channel-Specific Permissions:** Limit certain commands to designated channels, helping to prevent unnecessary clutter in general chat or sensitive areas.

7.  **Custom Commands and Responses**
    Minimod also supports custom commands, allowing server admins to define shortcuts for repetitive tasks or informational responses:

    *   **Custom Responses:** Create automatic responses for frequently asked questions or important server announcements.

    *   **Event Alerts:** Set up event alerts or automatic messages based on specific triggers, such as the server reaching a certain number of members.

8.  **Bot Security**
    Built with security in mind, Minimod ensures that the bot itself is protected from unauthorized access:

    *   **OAuth2 Authentication:** Ensures only verified servers can invite and use the bot.

    *   **Secure Data Storage:** Minimod stores all logs and user data in a secure, encrypted database to protect sensitive information.

    *   **Two-Factor Authentication:** Server owners and admins can enable 2FA for additional protection when managing the bot’s settings or accessing logs.

### Use Cases

Minimod is ideal for a variety of server environments:

*   **Gaming Communities:** Quickly deal with trolls, spammers, or people breaking the server’s code of conduct, while maintaining a fun and secure environment for players.

*   **Educational Servers:** Manage large communities with ease, setting up word filters to prevent offensive language, managing role assignments for students, and logging activities for transparency.

*   **Professional Servers:** Keep things professional and secure with anti-spam measures, role management, and detailed logs that ensure accountability.

### Future Features

Minimod is actively being developed, and future updates will include:

*   **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed statistics on server activity, member engagement, and the effectiveness of moderation actions.

*   **Multi-Language Support:** Expanding Minimod’s usability by adding translations and language-specific moderation rules.

*   **Integration with Other Services:** Potential for integration with platforms like GitHub, Trello, or Google Calendar to facilitate project management within server communities.
