This **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game, developed by Koala, is a fun and interactive web-based version of the classic hand game. Built with Python and soon to be converted to JavaScript for web deployment, this project introduces users to a lively gaming experience with animated visuals and responsive gameplay. Hosted on GitHub at [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](https://github.com/MistrKoala/rock-paper-scissors-game), it offers a fresh take on this timeless challenge.

### Game Overview

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple yet highly engaging game traditionally played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

*   **Rock**: Represented by a closed fist.

*   **Paper**: Represented by an open hand.

*   **Scissors**: Represented by two fingers extended like a pair of scissors.

The outcome is determined by these simple rules:

*   Rock crushes Scissors.

*   Scissors cuts Paper.

*   Paper covers Rock.

Koala’s version of the game lets you play against an AI opponent. Every round, the player selects one of the three moves, while the AI randomly selects its own. The winner is determined based on the standard rules, and the game tracks your overall performance across rounds.

### Features

1.  **Player vs AI Gameplay**
    In this version of the game, you face off against a computer-controlled AI opponent. The AI’s move is generated randomly, providing a fair and balanced challenge every time you play. There is no bias in the AI’s choices, so the player must rely on strategy and a bit of luck to win.

2.  **Score Tracking System**
    The game tracks both the player’s and the AI’s scores across multiple rounds. Each time a player wins, their score increases by one, and likewise for the AI. This allows players to compete over a series of rounds to see who can win the most games, adding an element of competition and progression.

3.  **Animated Player Choices**
    One of the standout features Koala is planning for the web version is **animated visuals** for each of the player and AI choices:

    *   When the player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, an animated image corresponding to their choice appears on the screen.

    *   The AI’s choice is revealed similarly through an animation, making each round more dynamic and visually engaging.

4.  **User-Friendly Interface**
    The game is designed to be simple and intuitive for users of all ages:

    *   A **clean layout** ensures that all options are easy to find, with clearly labeled buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

    *   A **central game area** displays the player’s and AI’s choices with clear animations and feedback on who won each round.

    *   **Score counters** are prominently displayed, showing the ongoing tally for both the player and AI, so users can easily keep track of their performance.

5.  **Responsive Design**
    The upcoming JavaScript version will be fully **responsive**, ensuring that the game looks and works beautifully across different devices:

    *   On desktop, the game will feature larger images and animations, with ample space for the buttons and scores.

    *   On mobile, the layout will adjust for touch-friendly controls, ensuring that the game is just as easy to play on smaller screens.

6.  **Smooth Animations and Interactivity**
    One of the main enhancements in the JavaScript version will be smooth animations that accompany player and AI choices:

    *   When a round starts, a countdown animation will build anticipation, showing both players’ hands ready to choose.

    *   After the choice is made, the hands transform into Rock, Paper, or Scissors with a slick animation, making the experience more engaging.

7.  **Results Feedback**
    At the end of each round, the game provides **clear feedback** on the outcome:

    *   A message is displayed announcing whether the player won, lost, or tied, adding a fun and competitive element to the game.

    *   The result is highlighted with different colors or animations to make it clear who came out on top.

8.  **Future Expansion: Player Customization**
    In future iterations of the game, Koala plans to introduce **customization options** for the player:

    *   Players may be able to choose different themes for the Rock, Paper, and Scissors images, such as using different characters, objects, or colors.

    *   Additional sound effects or background music may be added to enhance the atmosphere of the game.

### Technologies Used

1.  **Python (Original Version)**
    The original version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game was built using Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language. This initial version served as a prototype, providing a simple terminal-based interface for gameplay. Python’s built-in random module was used to generate the AI’s moves.

2.  **JavaScript (Web Version)**
    Koala is now converting the game to JavaScript to create a fully web-based experience. JavaScript allows for dynamic interactivity within web browsers and will be used to handle:

    *   Player input (detecting clicks on Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

    *   AI move generation.

    *   Animations for the choices and results.

    *   Score tracking and game logic.

3.  **HTML and CSS**
    The game’s structure is created with **HTML**, providing a solid foundation for the user interface. The game layout, buttons, and scoreboards are organized using HTML’s semantic elements. **CSS** will be used extensively to style the game, making it visually appealing and interactive:

    *   Buttons for selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors will be styled to stand out and be easily clickable.

    *   Animations, transitions, and hover effects will be implemented using CSS to provide smooth visual feedback during gameplay.

4.  **GitHub Hosting and Collaboration**
    The game is open-source and hosted on Koala’s GitHub page, where players and developers alike can explore the code and contribute to its development. You can check out the source code and track updates at [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game GitHub](https://github.com/MistrKoala/rock-paper-scissors-game).

### Project Goals

Koala’s primary goal with this project is to **create an interactive and engaging game** that anyone can enjoy, regardless of their skill level. By incorporating animations, score tracking, and responsive design, the game is designed to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

This project also serves as a **learning platform** for Koala, allowing them to enhance their skills in front-end web development, particularly in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The process of converting a Python-based terminal game into a full-fledged web application provides valuable experience in adapting logic and enhancing user experience.
