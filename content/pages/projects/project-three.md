This game is designed to be both educational and fun, featuring questions about country capitals, landmarks, flags, and other geography-related topics. The game is currently being developed for the web, utilizing front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a potential back-end for storing scores and creating leaderboards.

### Game Overview

The Country Quiz Game immerses players in a fast-paced trivia experience where they are challenged to answer a variety of questions related to countries. It’s designed to be engaging for players of all ages and knowledge levels, offering a great mix of questions that range from easy to difficult. The game can be played solo, or in a future update, potentially against other players in real-time.

### Features

1.  **Question Categories**
    The quiz features a diverse range of question types, each focusing on different aspects of countries:

    *   **Capitals:** Players are asked to match countries with their capitals. Example: "What is the capital of France?"

    *   **Flags:** The game presents players with images of flags, and they must identify which country the flag belongs to.

    *   **Landmarks:** Questions about famous landmarks will challenge players to associate a country with its well-known sites, such as the Eiffel Tower or the Great Wall of China.

    *   **General Geography:** Miscellaneous questions such as population size, location on the map, or continents the countries belong to.

2.  **Real-Time Gameplay**
    The game’s **real-time aspect** adds an extra layer of excitement. Players are given a limited amount of time to answer each question:

    *   **Timer-based questions:** Players must think quickly, as each question has a countdown timer, typically ranging from 10 to 30 seconds, depending on the difficulty level.

    *   **Streak System:** The game rewards players for consecutive correct answers by increasing their score multiplier, creating a more competitive and dynamic experience.

3.  **Multiple Game Modes**
    To keep the game fresh and exciting, Koala’s Country Quiz Game includes several different game modes:

    *   **Classic Mode:** The standard mode where players answer a set number of questions, and the goal is to get the highest score.

    *   **Time Attack:** Players try to answer as many questions as possible within a fixed time limit. Speed is key in this mode!

    *   **Challenge Mode:** Offers more difficult, niche questions related to country history, culture, and unique trivia.

    *   **Endless Mode (Future Update):** Players can keep playing until they get a question wrong. This mode will test endurance and depth of knowledge.

4.  **Interactive Visuals**
    A key feature of Koala’s Country Quiz Game is its **interactive and visually appealing interface**:

    *   **Flag and Landmark Images:** For flag-based and landmark-based questions, images are displayed in a clean, high-resolution format to enhance the user experience.

    *   **Map Animations:** Some questions are accompanied by an interactive world map, where players must click on the correct location of a country, adding a geographical element to the challenge.

    *   **Progressive Difficulty Levels:** As players progress, the questions get harder, and the visual clues become subtler, ensuring a challenging experience for geography enthusiasts.

5.  **Score and Leaderboard System**
    The game tracks the player’s score based on correct answers, streaks, and speed:

    *   **Points System:** Each correct answer earns points, with bonus points awarded for answering quickly and maintaining streaks.

    *   **Leaderboard:** Players can compete for the top spot on the game’s leaderboard, which may be **global** or **friends-only**. This feature encourages competitive play and helps players track their progress over time.

    *   **Personal Score History:** Each player can view their performance history, which records past scores and tracks improvements.

6.  **Login and Profile System**
    In future updates, the game will feature a **user login system**, enabling players to create profiles and save their progress:

    *   **Profile Customization:** Players will have the option to customize their profiles with avatars, country flags, and achievements.

    *   **Achievements and Badges:** The game will include achievements for special milestones, such as answering 50 questions correctly in a row, or getting every capital city correct in a single playthrough.

7.  **Educational Content**
    While the game is designed to be entertaining, it also serves as an educational tool:

    *   **Factoids after each question:** After each question, regardless of whether the answer is right or wrong, the game provides interesting facts about the country in question. For example, if a question asks about Japan's capital, the game might present additional information about Tokyo’s population, history, or culture.

    *   **Learning Mode (Future Update):** In this mode, players can take their time answering questions without a time limit, designed to help users learn and retain new knowledge about countries at their own pace.

8.  **Responsive Design**
    The Country Quiz Game is being developed with a **responsive design** to ensure seamless play on a variety of devices:

    *   On desktop, the game will feature larger, high-resolution images and an easy-to-navigate interface.

    *   On mobile, the interface will be optimized for touch controls, with larger buttons and compact visuals to fit smaller screens.

### Technologies Used

1.  **Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
    The front-end development is primarily handled with these core technologies:

    *   **HTML:** Used to structure the game’s user interface, including buttons, question areas, scoreboards, and images.

    *   **CSS:** Provides the visual styling for the game, ensuring a clean and modern look. CSS animations will also be used to create dynamic transitions between questions.

    *   **JavaScript:** Handles the logic for quiz questions, timers, score calculations, and interactivity. JavaScript also manages dynamic updates to the user interface, such as updating the score or switching to the next question.

2.  **Backend (Planned)**
    Koala plans to incorporate a backend system for handling user data, high scores, and leaderboards:

    *   **Database:** A database system will store user profiles, quiz history, and leaderboard data.

    *   **Authentication:** Players will be able to log in with their credentials, ensuring that their scores and progress are saved securely.

    *   **Server-Side Code:** This will handle data communication between the game and the database, allowing for real-time leaderboard updates and secure score tracking.

3.  **APIs for Geography Data (Future Consideration)**
    To keep the game content fresh and up-to-date, Koala may incorporate APIs that pull in real-time data about countries, allowing for dynamic questions based on current events or population statistics.

### Project Goals

The Country Quiz Game is more than just a casual quiz – it’s a fun and educational experience that helps players improve their geography knowledge while competing for high scores. Koala’s goal is to create a user-friendly, highly interactive, and educational platform that appeals to casual gamers, students, and geography enthusiasts alike.

By incorporating engaging visuals, varied game modes, and a competitive leaderboard, the Country Quiz Game offers a dynamic experience that keeps players coming back for more. As the project evolves, additional features like multiplayer options, global challenges, and new question categories will be added to expand the game’s depth.
